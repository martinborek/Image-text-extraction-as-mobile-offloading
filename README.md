# Temerarious Thirteens - Project 2 for CSE-4100

## How to start

The application can be deployed with either of the following commands, run in the project root:

```sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```
or
```sh
sudo bash deploy.sh
```

The deployment script will build the Android application as an APK file, which can then be installed to a device.
The APK file is saved to _TOCR-mobileUI/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk_.

The script will also deploy the backend as a clustered application in Google Container Engine, under the project _mcc-2016-g13-p2_.
By default, the script deploys 3 backend application pods and 3 database pods.

Superuser permissions are required for the deployment. Note: Google Cloud SDK, Docker and Kubernetes are set up as the 
root user by the script. Thus, all following commands related to these features must be run with _sudo_, to be able to 
access needed configuration files.

### Login credentials for the application:

You can either authenticate with an internal username and password or using any Facebook account.
The precreated internal users are listed in the table below.

| Username  | Password  |
|-----------|-----------|
| test1     | secret1   |
| test2     | secret2   |
| test3     | secret3   |

### Re-deploying & removing backend

To re-deploy the backend in Google Cloud, the previous deployment must be removed. This can be done with the following commands:

```sh
cd server
sudo ./undeploy.sh
```

## Extras
Besides the Android application fully working according to the project description, we have implemented two of the proposed challenges:
* Facebook authentication.
* Context-awareness, in case the user loses the internet connection after login.

## In this repository you will find

### Server
The backend server is implemented with Python 3, using Tornado as the HTTP server framework. The main backend application is in _server.py_, 
and some helper functions are in _helpers.py_ and _db_safe.py_.

The backend runs in a Docker container, which is defined in _Dockerfile_. The container uses the official Python image. 
The Docker container is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster on Google Container Engine. The cluster components are defined 
in _server/cluster/backend.yaml_.

The backend uses MongoDB as a database. The MongoDB cluster deployment functionality is in _server/cluster/sidecar_.
The Makefile and .yaml definitions have been copied and slightly altered from https://github.com/cvallance/mongo-k8s-sidecar.
The official MongoDB image is used in the cluster containers, along with the mongo-k8s-sidecar image, which controls 
the replica set.

The certificate files used for HTTPS communication are stored in _server/cert_ and the key used for accessing the Google 
Cloud project is in _server/key_

### TOCR-mobileUI
This is where the Android application source code is. Under _app/src/main/java/com/temerarious/mccocr13/temerariousocr/_ 
you can find the classes. They are separated in four groups: *activities*, with the actual activities of the application; *fragments*, 
basically with the fragment to handle the Facebook authentication; *helpers*, with several classes and methods to support the 
activities; and *tasks*, with the local and async tasks to run the OCR and communicate with the server.

### Documentation
In this folder you can find the file _cluster_commands.txt_, which describes some commands for controlling the cluster, 
and the file _remote_ocr_processing.txt_ with detailed information on how some of the REST communication works in this application.
